## Summary

- The code we used to determine the election can be simply modified to be used in future elections. Since the code is already in place we would just have to create new dictionaries for the new candiates and update the counties to those that fit the election. If we organize each potential election into dictionaries of counties, cities, and states, in the future we would just have to update the candidates. The bulk of the workload can be front ended. 

- This same code can be used to find the winner to a chief of police in a town. Also school board elections. Instead of states or cities, the code would have dictionaries that have to do with sections of a town, age, and political stance.
